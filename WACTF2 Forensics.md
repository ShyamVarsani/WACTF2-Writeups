# _WACTF2 2018 FORENSICS Writeups - Shyamal Varsani (**@baconandegg5**)_

## Forensics-0
> For the forensics-0 challenge in WACTF2, we were given a jpeg file in which we were required to give a SHA1 hash of

To do this, I used `sha1sum`, which is a tool that prints (to stdout) or checks SHA1 (160-bit) checksums.

This was a fairly straightfoward procedure, which can be seen below:

```
root@kali:~/Desktop/Forensics-0# sha1sum delicious.jpg 
abf03b17013e5aa440ba8c5cac11c4dec18e4084  delicious.jpg
```
This digest in conjuction with the flag format, gave us the flag:

*WACTF2{abf03b17013e5aa440ba8c5cac11c4dec18e4084}*

## Forensics-1

> For the forensics-1 challenge in WACTF2, we were presented with a SQLite 3 database in which we had to find the user's password

Used the `file` command to try and determine what I was dealing with:
```
root@kali:~/Desktop/Forensics-1# file mmssms.db
mmssms.db: SQLite 3.x database, user version 67, last written using SQLite version 3022000 
```
I had learnt about another common service previously running on Linux system called MySQL during the completion of the PentesterLab's Unix Badge. As I expected the SQLite CLI to be similiar to I deployed similiar tactics to how I would access a MySQL database.

I initially opened the database using `sqlite3`:

```
root@kali:~/Desktop/Forensics-1# sqlite3 mmssms.db 
SQLite version 3.25.3 2018-11-05 20:37:38
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .tables

```
Within this database, I found a number of tables that existed using `sqlite> .tables`.

I then saw the _sms_ table, and thought that the password would have communicated via sms, so i `sqlite> select * from sms;` (select all data from the sms table), which displayed a series of messages.

It was possible to see that six messages had either been sent/recived, with the fifth one being the password which was: Siliciumphantomplant

## Forensics-2

>We were given a .tar archive, where we were told that a person had messed up the compression of a file due to making a mistake been Gif and Jif. 

I initially went on to extract the 'mybeloved.tar' archive that was supplied to us, which gave the output of 3 .txt files (Flash_Animation.txt,GIF.txt and Meme.txt). I spent a while looking at these text files trying to discern if anything fishy was going on them but I had hit a wall for a period of time. 

I tried using `binwalk` on the tar archive, which resulted in the following:
```
root@kali:~/Desktop/Forensics-2# binwalk mybeloved.tar 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             POSIX tar archive, owner user name: "imation.txt"

```

All binwalk had shown here was that this file was a POSIX tar archive, but what had caught my eye was the "imation.txt". I spent the next half hour trying to see if i could find the *imation.txt* in the .tar file. 

I then pestered the don @Snide during Pizza time on Day 1 (props for creating this challenge). I  attempted to ask for any hints, and he told me to _Try Harder_ && _Look at it differently dude_. I then tried a bunch of things to avail, until I realized that I hadn't done the most basic of stuff with the .tar archive.

I then went to `strings` the .tar file, where I found the following:

```
<SNIPPED>
heritage.jif
0100777
0000000
0000000
00004263244
13367576604
010333
ustar
JIF89a@
( #1"
%$%#.%
,,+.-
&)y>.
'5%06
342<6
<SNIPPED>
```
This was the .jif file the challenge prompt was talking about!

The attempt that was successful in pulling out this file was to run `bless` (hex editor) on the .tar file. 

In bless I deleted everything that came before (upto the 4A 49 46 38 39 61) header and everything that was after the heritage.gif portion starting from the next file's header.

Before saving this block of bytes/file, the header had to be changed from 4A 49 46 38 39 61 (JIF89a) >> 47 49 46 38 39 61 (GIF89a).

I then saved this file (as blessed.gif), and it opened as a valid .gif when using `eog` (eye-of-gnome/image viewer). When viewing the gif, it was possible to some quick flashes/frames that looked out of norm. 

Using `ffmpeg` (image and audio manipulator), to pull out every single individual frame out of the GIF for inspection, by doing the following:
`ffmpeg -i blessed.gif thumb%04d.jpg -hide_banner`

This resulted in a total of 152 frames being extracted, and when using `eog` to open all of them, I found the flag in classic Snide fashion with a Haunter Pokemon background on frame 121.

## Forensics-3

>In this challenge, we were given a packet capture, which we were told some secret communication of somesort was taking place? Strange mane?

I opened up the provided *forensics3.pcapng* in `wireshark` (packet capture multitool) to analyze and sift through the network traffic that had been captured.

The initial look in wireshark didn't immediately show anything that stood out, so i binwalked the .pcapng to pull out everything that has a valid header from it, using:
`Binwalk --dd='.*' forensics3.pcapng`

I was looking through the extracted files, and found that there was this png diagram talking about TCP over ICMP.

I researched more about IP/TCP over ICMP, and learnt that you could use ping/ICMP packets to dissassamble/send/recieve IP/TCP stuff over pings with requests and replies.

When Inspecting the ICMP packets and applying a filter 'icmp', so that you view ICMP packets, I was able to determine that not all of the ICMP were alike:

The data portions of various ICMP packets revealed the following:

```

It was obvious from looking at the data that there is base64 encoded data hidden in these packets. As the data had been split up into 3 part, it was neccesary to reconstitute the parts back together, before decoding it:

The file that can be seen above is the /etc/~shadow file, this can be distinguished by the asterisks after the user's names, indicating the hashes have been shadowed/hidden.
Contrary to this, we can see by observation that in the place where the users hashes are shadowed, we can find the roots 'hash' contains the flag for this challenge.

## Forensics-4

> This is a challenge where we were given 2 disk images (dm-0.img & dm-1.img) and a android backup to analyze, in the hopes of finding out about some sort of nefarious activity using a encrypted sms system of somes sort? 

This challenge was done fairly simply using Autopsy 4.9.1 after multiple efforts with Autopsy 2.24 were undertaken.

I had initally loaded up both disk images in Autopsy 2.24 on my Kali VM and traversing through the file system trying to locate anything that looked suspicious in nature, that would imply that anything to do with a encrypted sms service. A keyword search in Autopsy 2.24 of 'WACTF' lead me to a little png WACTF logo which was located /0/media/download. I found an .apk (android application)file called thoughtcrime.securesms.421.apk on the dm-1.img. Note - I never found anything of too much value on dm-0.img

I ran `apktool` on the thoughtcrime.securesms.421.apk to attempt to disassemble it and traverse through the backend of the application in the hopes of a key/flag being hidden internally, within the application, but that just proved to be a massive red herring in the end?

After many,many hours, I had loaded up the images into v4.9.1 on a Windows VM and found that when I did a keyword search of 'wactf', a database file by the name of *msgstore.db*, which resided in 
**/img_dm-1.img/user/0/com.whatsapp/databases/msgstore.db** was found to contain a flag of:

*WACTF2{0P$3c_Ab0ve_A77}*

>I will keep in mind for next time I undertake any sort of forensics on disk images that Autopsy 4.9.1 is much more powerful than v2.24 ;) and i should never use the version that comes with kali natively ;) 

---

All in all, I learnt a bunch of lessons completing these challenges! and I hope to compete in WACTF once again in the years to come :)
